## Getting Started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Discord Profile Widgets (Experimental)**
>
> Discord Profile Widgets are currently an experimental feature. Follow [Chloe Cinders' Blog Guide](https://chloecinders.com/blog/discord-widgets#displaying-the-widget-on-your-profile) to enable the required Discord experiments, create and publish your widget, and add it to your Discord profile before continuing.

> [!TIP]
> **Faster Setup Option**
>
> To avoid manually creating the widget, setting up the layout, and adding each field, you can use the [Discord-Widgets-Extension](https://github.com/TheCreativeGod/Discord-Widgets-Extension) by TheCreativeGod to import the pre-configured [`widget-config.json`](./imports/widget-config.json) file. See the [Widget Import Guide](./imports/guide.md) for step-by-step instructions.

After creating your Discord Profile Widget, add the following fields under **Games -> Widget** in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
